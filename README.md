# Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) Resources

This repository is intended to collect resources related to **Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI)** with a focus on **academia**, including presentations, activities, and data.

The goal is to make these resources more accessible and to support **fact-based decisions** that can help improve equity, diversity, and inclusion within our institutions.

Please note that many of these materials — particularly presentations and activities — were created for specific audiences and often for in-person events. As a result, some slides or documents might lack context or contain minor errors.  
If you notice any issues or missing context, we encourage you to **open an issue** or, even better, **submit a Pull Request (PR)** with your suggested fixes or improvements.

## Justification

We found that much of the understanding and discussion around EDI in academia is based on **personal experience**. While such perspectives are valuable, they are often **incomplete and potentially biased**. Fortunately, there is a growing body of studies and data-driven analyses that aim to build understanding grounded in evidence, using individual experiences to **illustrate rather than prove** key points.  

Unfortunately, this information is often **scattered and difficult to access**. This repository aims to help fill that gap by collecting and organizing relevant materials for the community.  

For example, a recurring challenge in organizing scientific events with diverse panels is assessing whether the representation truly reflects the community. Having access to **datasets from major conferences** could serve as valuable reference points to inform decisions in a variety of contexts.  

Of course, such data comes with its own limitations and biases, but it still provides a **solid zero-order approximation** to support more quantitative evaluations of our collective efforts toward diversity and inclusion — and, equally importantly, to **track progress over time**.
