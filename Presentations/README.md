# Presentations

Please follow these guidelines when adding new presentations:

- Create a **separate folder** for each presentation.  
- Name each folder using the **event name and year** (e.g., `Inclusive_Science_Workshop_2025`).  
- Include a `README.md` file inside your presentation folder with:
  - The **title** of your presentation  
  - A **contact name and email** (if you are comfortable being contacted for questions)

Thank you for helping keep this repository organized and useful!
