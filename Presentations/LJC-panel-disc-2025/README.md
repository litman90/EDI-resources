The [Lennard Jones Centre](https://ljc.group.cam.ac.uk/) brings together researchers from different departments across the University of Cambridge with a common interest in materials and molecular modelling.

The [LJC Gender Equality Network](https://ljc.group.cam.ac.uk/gender-equality-network) aims to promote equality, diversity, and inclusion in the molecular and materials modelling community by empowering women and minority genders in our field.
